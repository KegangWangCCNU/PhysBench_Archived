### Please use the [Tutorial/Noob Heart.ipynb](https://github.com/KegangWangCCNU/PhysBench/blob/main/Tutorial/Noob%20Heart.ipynb) to learn about this framework.  
Although I personally prefer to use TensorFlow, PhysBench is not tied to any specific deep learning framework. For Pytorch and JAX users, please refer to:[Tutorial/Noob Heart (Pytorch).ipynb](https://github.com/KegangWangCCNU/PhysBench/blob/main/Tutorial/Noob%20Heart%20(Pytorch).ipynb) and [Tutorial/Noob Heart (JAX).ipynb](https://github.com/KegangWangCCNU/PhysBench/blob/main/Tutorial/Noob%20Heart%20(JAX).ipynb)

## Environments  
First, create a new environment for PhysBench.
```
conda create -n physbench python=3.9
conda activate physbench
pip install -r requirements
```
Then, install the deep learning frameworks according to your needs. If you need to install multiple frameworks, it is recommended to create different environments for them.  
Install TensorFlow environment:
```
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.10 keras==2.10
```
Install Pytorch environment:
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
## Inference on a single video  
To extract BVP signals from your own collected video, please execute the following code.  
```
python inference.py --video face.avi --out BVP.csv 
```  
Its output `BVP.csv` contains the BVP signal values corresponding to each frame.   
By default, it uses a pre-trained Seq-rPPG model on RLAP using TensorFlow.

## Models  

We implemented 7 neural models and 3 unsupervised models, DeepPhys, TS-CAN, EfficientPhys, PhysNet, PhysFormer, 1D CNN, NoobHeart, Chrom, ICA, and POS. Among them, the Seq-rPPG is a new model we proposed that uses only one-dimensional convolution with minimal computational complexity and high performance. NoobHeart is a toy model used in the tutorial with only 361 parameters and includes a simple 2 layers 3-dimensional convolution structure; however it has decent performance making it suitable as an entry-level model. Chrom，ICA，and POS are three unsupervised models. Among the neural models，PhysFormer is implemented using Pytorch while others use Tensorflow.  

For unsupervised methods, please refer to `unsupervised_methods.py`; for methods implemented using TensorFlow, please refer to `models.py`; for methods implemented using PyTorch, please refer to `models_torch.py`. Our framework is not dependent on a specific deep learning framework. Please configure the environment as needed and install the required packages using `requirements.txt`.

## Add new models (supervised or unsupervised) 

For any model, whether it's Tensorflow, Pytorch, or using Numpy, the input is facial video clips and the output is corresponding physiological signals.
The only thing that needs to be done is to encapsulate the algorithm into a function, inputting video frames and outputting BVP signals or heart rate.
```python
def model(frames):
    # Frames is (Batch, Depth, H, W, C) matrix, only contain the face.
    input = preprocess(frames) # Preprocessing (if necessary)
    BVP   = algorithm(input)  
    return BVP                 # (Batch, Depth)
    
# Evaluate the model on the HDF5 standard dataset
eval_on_dataset('test_set.h5', model, depth, (H, W), save='results/my_result.h5')

# Obtain HR metrics
hr_metrics = get_metrics('results/my_result.h5')

# Obtain HRV metrics
hrv_metrics = get_metrics_HRV('results/my_result.h5')
```
Open the visualization webpage, where you can find my_result.h5 and view the waveform of each video.  
```
python visualization.py
```

## Datasets  
Adding a dataset is simple, just write a loader and include a index file (usually only 20 lines of code). Currently supported loaders are RLAP (i.e., CCNU), UBFC-rPPG2, UBFC-PHYS, MMPD, PURE, COHFACE, and SCAMPS. You can use our recording program PhysRecorder https://github.com/KegangWangCCNU/PhysRecorder to record datasets, just need a webcam and Contec CMS50E to collect strictly synchronized lossless format datasets, which can be directly used with the RLAP loader.  
It's recommended to train on datasets with Good Synchronicity, as most models are highly sensitive to the synchronicity of the training set. Moreover, not all videos in UBFC-rPPG are unsynchronized; based on experience, some models with a Temporal Shift Module (TSM) can adapt to it, such as TS-CAN and EfficientPhys, but their performance is still inferior compared to training on highly synchronized datasets.  
|Dataset|Participants|Frames|Lossless|Synchronicity|  
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  
|RLAP|58|3.53M|MJPG|Good|   
|RLAP-rPPG|58|781K|YES|Good|  
|PURE|10|106K|YES|Good|  
|UBFC-rPPG|42|75K|YES|Bad| 
|UBFC-Phys|56|1.06M|MJPG|-| 
|MMPD|33|1.15M|H.264|-|
|COHFACE|40|192K|MPEG-4|Good|  
|SCAMPS|2800|1.68M|Synthetics|Good|  

You need to organize an index file for each dataset, and PhysBench provides the official versions of these files. Usually, you don't need to change the folder structure of the datasets to use them. Please check the csv files in the `datasets` folder.

**Note: Our framework implemented UBFC-Phys, but due to the large motion amplitude, there is a lot of noise in its Ground Truth, and the test results may not be reliable, so they are not listed. Further measures may need to be taken to filter out inaccurate Ground Truth signals before the results can be released.**

## Add new datasets  

To add a new dataset, two things need to be prepared: adding a Loader and organizing a file index.  
Taking MMPD as an example:
```python
class LoaderMMPD(Loader):

    def __call__(self, vid):                        # vid is the relative path of the video file.
        path = f"{self.base}{vid}"                  # Obtain the absolute path
        f = scipy.io.loadmat(path)                  
        bvp = f['GT_ppg'][0]                        # (Depth, )
        ts = np.arange(bvp.shape[0])/30 # 30fps     # (Depth, )
        vid = (f['video']*255).astype(np.uint8)     # (Depth, H, W, C)
        return vid, bvp, ts                         # Return video frame, BVP, timestamps
        
loader_mmpd = LoaderMMPD(mmpd_root) # Use the MMPD dataset root directory to initialize the loader.

# Use Loader to package the MMPD raw dataset into a HDF5 standard dataset, witch can be used for testing models.
dump_dataset("mmpd_dataset.h5", files_mmpd, loader_mmpd, labels=labels_list)
```

## Train and Test
Train on our RLAP dataset, please see the `benchmark_RLAP` folder. Train on the SCAMPS dataset, please see the `benchmark_SCAMPS` folder. In addition, for ablation experiments and training on PURE and UBFC, please see `benchmark_addition`. All code is provided in Jupyter notebooks with our replication included; if you have read the tutorial, replicating results should be easy.   

## Training evaluation on RLAP  
RLAP is an appropriate training set, and we divide RLAP into training ,validation and testing set. In addition, tests were also conducted on the entire UBFC and PURE datasets. For code and results, please refer to `benchmark_RLAP`.  
The testing on the RLAP and RLAP-rPPG dataset is different from other datasets. Due to the longer duration of RLAP dataset videos, a 30s moving window is used instead of the entire video for heart rate prediction. For other datasets, the entire 1min video is used for heart rate prediction.

### Cross-dataset testing on UBFC-rPPG  

The videos and physiological signals of UBFC-rPPG are not strictly synchronized, which results in a fixed error between the heart rate extracted by the rPPG algorithm and GT. Therefore, the error limit of UBFC-rPPG is approximately Pearson's coefficient 0.997, and further improvement in model accuracy will not yield better metrics.

### Cross-dataset testing on PURE  

Unsupervised methods are usually sensitive to preprocessing and postprocessing, and many parameters affect their performance. PhysBench optimizes these additional steps as much as possible to fully demonstrate the model's performance. Surprisingly, POS outperforms most supervised methods on the PURE dataset, and after careful verification, the results are genuine.

### Cross-dataset testing on MMPD-Simplest  

Referencing https://github.com/McJackTang/MMPD_rPPG_dataset, we tested all models in the simplest scenario. MMPD is a highly compressed dataset using H.264 encoding, which may affect some compression-sensitive models. In the simplest scenario, it only contains light skin samples and no head movement.  
The simplest scenario is as follows: `motion='Stationary', skin_color='3', light=['LED-high', 'LED-low', 'Incandescent']`
|Model|MAE|RMSE|Pearson Coef.|   
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  
|DeepPhys|1.03|1.46|0.987|  
|TS-CAN|0.95|1.40|0.989|  
|EfficientPhys|1.57|5.40|0.821|  
|PhysNet|0.97|1.45|0.988|  
|PhysFormer|1.70|4.13|0.890|  
|Seq-rPPG|1.52|3.93|0.915|  
|NoobHeart|2.78|6.31|0.763|  
|Chrom|12.2|19.2|0.151|  
|ICA|4.08|9.45|0.642|  
|POS|4.30|10.8|0.426|  

### Cross-dataset testing on COHFACE  

COHFACE is a dataset using MPEG-4 compression with a very high compression ratio, and the size of each video does not exceed 2MB, which causes most rPPG algorithms to fail on it. However, some structures show robustness to high compression ratios: such as DeepPhys-like structures that input the difference between video frames and output the difference in BVP. In addition, other poorly performing algorithms are not completely without performance; due to the failure of predicting some videos, this part of the error is actually meaningless and more appropriate metrics should be found to measure performance.

|Model|MAE|RMSE|Pearson Coef.|   
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  
|DeepPhys|2.75|8.63|0.733|  
|TS-CAN|2.28|7.81|0.774|  
|EfficientPhys|3.94|12.0|0.528|  
|PhysNet|19.6|26.9|-0.45|  
|PhysFormer|20.0|26.1|-0.37|  
|Seq-rPPG|16.1|25.7|-0.12|  
|NoobHeart|25.0|29.5|-0.36|  
|Chrom|27.4|32.4|-0.32|  
|ICA|7.91|16.1|0.282|  
|POS|22.3|29.9|-0.32|  

## Training evaluation on SCAMPS  
Training on synthetic datasets is difficult, and we observed that overfitting can easily occur, requiring many steps to prevent overfitting, such as controlling the learning rate, additional regularization operations, etc. Smaller models may not be prone to overfitting; NoobHeart is an example where we froze the LayerNormalization layer with initial parameters and trained for 5 epochs while achieving similar performance as training on real datasets. This could be the first step in training on synthetic datasets.  

Referencing https://github.com/remotebiosensing/rppg and [rPPG-Toolbox](https://github.com/ubicomplab/rPPG-Toolbox), we use OneCycle learning rate and AdamW optimizer to mitigate overfitting, and train DeepPhys.

|Model|MAE|RMSE|Pearson Coef.|   
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  
|DeepPhys|9.51|18.2|0.608|  
|NoobHeart|1.05|1.49|0.997|  

### Cross-dataset testing on PURE  
|Model|MAE|RMSE|Pearson Coef.|

## Visualization  
Please run `visualization.py` to open the visualization webpage. Before visualizing, make sure all result files are saved in the `results` folder. When the framework generates result files, it links to the dataset files, so the visualization webpage can display face images synchronously. Once the link is invalid, such as when dataset files are moved, faces cannot be displayed on the webpage.  

## Limitation  
The test data used by PhysBench may not necessarily reflect the accuracy in real-world scenarios, where there are more diverse lighting conditions, head movements, skin tones and age groups. The heart rate provided by the algorithm through Welch method may not fully comply with medical standards and requires further rigorous evaluation before clinical use. We aim to inform users of the weaknesses and limitations of the algorithm as much as possible through the visualization webpage.
